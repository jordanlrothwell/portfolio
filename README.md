## üìã Project Description

I was tasked with desigining a **portfolio page** which met the following criteria:
- name
- recent photo or avatar
- functioning links to sections:
    - about
    - projects
        - first project is bigger than others
        - links to project
    - contact
- responsive layout which adapts to different viewports

## ‚úíÔ∏è Design 

I had grand plans for the design of this landing page. I'm a fan of ocean themes, and set my heart on a modified version of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWCCgQMwdik&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) design:

This proved to be finnicky, and I quickly abandoned it in favour of a modified version of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJNhM8i-nc&list=PL4-IK0AVhVjMSb9c06AjRlTpvxL3otpUd&ab_channel=KevinPowell) landing page design:

After some tinkering, I decided to start all over again so that a. I understood the design process better, and b. so that I understood what I was tinkering with.

I settled on a [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-developer-portfolio-website/#whatisadeveloperportfoliowebsite) by freecodecamp, because although I had some serious guard rails, I would hopefully be able to recreate a future ('real') version off the page using what I had learned. 

I learned a lot about design best practice and priciples, although I'm not ashamed to say that most of what I learned didn't make it into the submitted version.

I was conscious that I had limited time, and settled for a functioning version which (hopefully) met the above criteria to a standard I could stomach (if only because I'd be able to re-create it later).

## Things I'd Change

A lot.

I took the attitude that I wasn't going to be able to focus on internalising the design process at the same time as (properly) applying some of the things I'd already learned.

Off the top of my head:

- the overall design
- better use of font to distinguish headings vs. paragraphs
- better use of colour
- redundant CSS
- accessibility
- my design process/workflow
- add socials (e.g. github/linkedin/etc)
- add skills (e.g. html, CSS, js)
- add own design/logo
- code comments
