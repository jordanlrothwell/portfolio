## üìã Project Description

I was tasked with desigining a portfolio page which met the following criteria:
- name
- recent photo or avatar
- functioning links to sections:
    - about
    - projects
        - first project is bigger than others
        - links to project
    - contact
- responsive layout which adapts to different viewports

## ‚úíÔ∏è Design 

I had grand plans for the design of this landing page. I'm a fan of ocean themes, and set my heart on a modified version of this design:

This proved to be finnicky, and I quickly abandoned it in favour of a modified version of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJNhM8i-nc&list=PL4-IK0AVhVjMSb9c06AjRlTpvxL3otpUd&ab_channel=KevinPowell) landing page design:

After some tinkering, I decided to start all over again so that a. I understood the design process better, and b. so that I understood what I was tinkering with.

I settled on a [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-developer-portfolio-website/#whatisadeveloperportfoliowebsite) by freecodecamp, because although I had some serious guard rails, I would hopefully be able to recreate a future ('real') version off the page using what I had learned. 

I learned a lot about design best practice and priciples, although I'm not ashamed to say that most of what I learned didn't make it into the submitted version.

I was conscious that I had limited time, and settled for a functioning version which (hopefully) met the above criteria to a standard I could stomach (if only because I'd be able to re-create it later).
